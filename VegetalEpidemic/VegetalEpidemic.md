##Vegetal Epidemic 
You want to create a cellular automaton to sketch the problem of propagation of an epidemic.
Consider a simple (invented) ideal case of a plant disease, which propagates in cultivation, where the plants were placed in a square lattice, with the exception of the points, where are rocky outcrops.

The disease is benign when the plant becomes infected, incubation period of the disease is one day, after which the disease manifests itself. At this stage, the plant infected plants that surround it. After a day, the plant enters into the healing phase, it is no longer infectious, nor it can subsequently become ill.
